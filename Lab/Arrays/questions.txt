---------
example.c

1) What is the cause of the seg fault in the program called example.c?

	- The for loop had no break and would continue to exectute over and
	  over. Then, a value in the array tried to be added to sum, however
	  the value of the array that tried to be added to sum was not a valid
	  index in the originally initialized array.

--------
broken.c

2) What line in broken.c did the program seg fault on?

	-  Program seg faulted on line 28.

3) What was the value of the variable "count" at the time of the seg fault?

	-  The value of count at the time of the seg fault was 10.

4) What was the value of the variable "i" at the time of the seg fault?

	-  The value of i at the time of the seg fault was 773.

5) What was the value of the variable "search" at the time of the seg fault?

	-  The value of search at the time of the seg fault was 1.

6) What are the values in the "table" array?

	-  {5, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26}

7) what do you think the bug is?

	-  I think the bug is an error in the while statement where it
	   is missing a comparison for search since only one "=" sign
	   was used.
